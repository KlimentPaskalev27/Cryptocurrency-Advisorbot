# Cryptocurrency-Advisorbot
A command line application in C++ which can tokenise a spreadsheet of data with info on cryptocurrencies. The app has a list of functions and options available to the user where the user can obtain analytical insights from the bot based on the info the bot has read. The app also has a portfolio buy/sell simulation.

## Test locally
Just make sure when you download the src code and the spreadsheet, that you remember to check that the path to the spreadsheet file is correct in the CSVReader.cpp and CSVReader.h files, so that the Advisorbot can read the data.

## Demo
Here is a demo where I show all the functionality of the bot. Enjoy!
